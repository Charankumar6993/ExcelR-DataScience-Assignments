    "## Analysis and Interpretation of Association Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "These rules give insights into how customers group products during their purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Overall Observations\n",
    "- Rules with **high lift (>1)** indicate strong positive associations between items, meaning they occur together more often than random chance.\n",
    "- Rules with **high confidence** indicate reliable behaviour — when a customer buys the antecedent items, they are likely to buy the consequent items as well.\n",
    "- High-support rules represent **popular combinations** in customer baskets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Interpretation of Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rule Example:** `{Item A} -> {Item B}`  \n",
    "  - *Meaning:* Customers who buy Item A often also buy Item B.  \n",
    "  - *Insight:* These items complement each other. Consider placing them together or promoting them as a bundle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rule Example:** `{Item X, Item Y} -> {Item Z}`  \n",
    "  - *Meaning:* When customers purchase X and Y together, they commonly add Z.  \n",
    "  - *Insight:* Suggest Z during checkout or offer a combo deal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rule Example:** `{Item M} -> {Item N}` with high lift  \n",
    "  - *Meaning:* Item M strongly drives the purchase of Item N.  \n",
    "  - *Insight:* Item M can be used for targeted recommendations or cross-selling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Customer Purchasing Behaviour\n",
    "- Customers tend to buy **complementary items**, which opens up opportunities for combo offers.\n",
    "- Some products appear repeatedly in strong rules, indicating **key driver products**.\n",
    "- High-confidence rules reveal **predictable buying behavior**, useful for recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Business Recommendations\n",
    "- Place strongly associated items **next to each other** in the store or online.\n",
    "- Create **bundle discounts** for frequently co-purchased products.\n",
    "- Use the rules to build **recommendation systems** that suggest items during checkout.\n",
    "- Keep high-support item combinations **consistently stocked**.\n",

    "# Interview Questions & Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. What is lift and why is it important in Association rules?**  \n",
    "Lift = confidence(X → Y) / support(Y). Lift > 1 means X and Y occur together more often than expected by chance. It highlights truly meaningful associations beyond random co-occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What is support and confidence? How do you calculate them?**  \n",
    "- Support = count(X ∪ Y) / total transactions → how frequently an itemset appears.  \n",
    "- Confidence = count(X ∪ Y) / count(X) → probability of Y being purchased when X is purchased.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What are some limitations of Association Rules Mining?**  \n",
    "- Requires careful threshold tuning (support/confidence/lift).\n",
    "- Sparsity in large item universes reduces meaningful rules.\n",
    "- Does not imply causation — only association.\n",
    "- For continuous data, requires binning or discretization.\n"
